## Overview

This repository contains a collection of 3D models used for augmented reality applications. These models are available in various file formats to cater to different needs and software compatibility. The supported 3D model formats include:

1. **STL (Stereolithography):** STL files are commonly used for 3D printing and represent 3D objects using triangular facets.

2. **OBJ (Wavefront Object):** OBJ files are versatile and can store 3D geometry, textures, and materials, making them suitable for a wide range of applications.

3. **FBX (Filmbox):** FBX files support the exchange of 3D models and animations between different software applications, making them ideal for interactive projects.

4. **DAE (Collada):** Collada files (DAE) are XML-based and can store 3D models, animations, and metadata, making them suitable for various applications.

5. **3DS (3D Studio):** 3DS files, originally developed for Autodesk's 3D Studio, may be used when compatibility with older software is required.

6. **PLY (Polygon File Format):** PLY files are often used for point cloud data and mesh geometry, making them useful in computer graphics and 3D scanning.

7. **BLEND (Blender):** Blender's proprietary BLEND format is used for storing 3D models and scenes. This format is primarily compatible with Blender software.

8. **MAX (Autodesk 3ds Max):** MAX files are specific to Autodesk's 3ds Max software and are used for storing scenes and models.

9. **GLTF/GLB (GL Transmission Format):** GLTF is a popular format for web-based 3D applications and AR/VR experiences. GLB is a binary version of GLTF, packaging everything into a single file.
