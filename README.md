## Overview

Welcome to the Augmented Reality project! This repository contains a collection of 3D models used for augmented reality applications. These models are available in various file formats to cater to different needs and software compatibility.

Supported 3D model formats:

| Format                           | Description                                                    |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **STL (Stereolithography)**     | STL files are commonly used for 3D printing and represent 3D objects using triangular facets. |
| **OBJ (Wavefront Object)**       | OBJ files are versatile and can store 3D geometry, textures, and materials, making them suitable for a wide range of applications. |
| **FBX (Filmbox)**                | FBX files support the exchange of 3D models and animations between different software applications, making them ideal for interactive projects. |
| **DAE (Collada)**                | Collada files (DAE) are XML-based and can store 3D models, animations, and metadata, making them suitable for various applications. |
| **3DS (3D Studio)**              | 3DS files, originally developed for Autodesk's 3D Studio, may be used when compatibility with older software is required. |
| **PLY (Polygon File Format)**    | PLY files are often used for point cloud data and mesh geometry, making them useful in computer graphics and 3D scanning. |
| **BLEND (Blender)**              | Blender's proprietary BLEND format is used for storing 3D models and scenes. This format is primarily compatible with Blender software. |
| **MAX (Autodesk 3ds Max)**       | MAX files are specific to Autodesk's 3ds Max software and are used for storing scenes and models. |
| **GLTF/GLB (GL Transmission Format)** | GLTF is a popular format for web-based 3D applications and AR/VR experiences. GLB is a binary version of GLTF, packaging everything into a single file. |
